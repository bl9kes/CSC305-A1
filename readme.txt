CSC 305 Assignment 1 - Read me


This project successfully implements all the requirements listed in the assignment.


1. Real-time Synchronization of Animations (2 Marks)


All animations in the scene are synchronized using real-time updates. 


2. Space Jelly Tentacle Modelling (4 Marks)


The space jelly model consists of a body made up of two scaled spheres. Each tentacle is composed of five ellipses (scaled spheres), resulting in a total of three tentacles with correct structure and form.


3. Space Jelly Tentacle Animation (Moving Wave) (4 Marks)


Each tentacle is the same follows a wave animation and runs as expected.


4. Space Jelly Tentacle Positioning (3 Tentacles) (3 Marks)


The space jelly is correctly positioned with three evenly spaced tentacles. Their placement is symmetric and visually consistent with the reference example.


5. Space Jelly Animation (4 Marks)


The space jelly moves in a circular path around the astronaut. It remains aligned with the tangent of the circle.


6. Astronaut Modelling (6 Marks)


The astronaut model includes: A helmet with a visor, two arms, two legs (upper leg, lower leg, and feet), a NASA patch, and the 6 various inlets and outlets for added detail.


The model is visually accurate and proportionate.


7. Astronaut Body Animation (2 Marks)


The astronaut oscillates in both the x and y directions.


8. Astronaut Leg and Arm Animation (6 Marks)


The astronaut’s legs perform a kicking motion, with both hips and knees rotating correctly while keeping the feet static.


The arms rotate out in sync like windshield wipers.


9. Starfield Animation (4 Marks)


Stars are randomly seeded in the background.


Stars move offscreen and are reset to a new random location offscreen, ensuring a consistent number of stars in the scene at all times. Stars have a uniform but random scaling.


10. Scene Layout and Visual Accuracy (4 Marks)


The scene fits within the 512x512 window dimensions.


Object placements and animations are similar to the provided example, maintaining a clear and visually appealing composition.


11. Programming Style (2 Marks)


The code is well-structured and commented.
Failed to create working functions for the tentacles.
Good use of variables for calculations to reduce redundancy.
Good use of pops and pushes.
Similar structure throughout and is relatively easy to follow.
Naming conventions and indentation are consistent.
